# Dog List: Privacy policy

---------------------------------

Welcome to the Dog List App!

This is an open source App developed by Jack Davis. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license: <https://github.com/jackdavis01/mobile2/tree/main/doglist>.

The App is currently available on:

1. Android: Google Play

Search for "Dog List".

I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when Apps collect your data without your knowledge.

Privacy Policy for Advertising and Data Collection

Our app includes advertisements provided by Google AdMob and ironSource. Please note the following information about our data collection practices related to advertising:

1. AdMob & ironSource Integration

    We have integrated Google AdMob and ironSource as advertising providers to deliver ads that may be relevant to you. AdMob and ironSource may collect and use data to show targeted ads based on your interests.

2. Collection of Advertising ID

    To facilitate personalized advertising, our app collects the Advertising ID from your device. The Advertising ID is a unique identifier assigned to your device for advertising purposes and is managed by the operating system. This identifier is used to serve personalized ads and improve ad relevance.

3. Third-Party Data Use

    The data collected by Google AdMob is governed by Google's Privacy Policy and data processing practices. You may review Google's Privacy Policy for more details on how Google handles your data.
    The data collected by ironSource is governed by ironSource's Privacy Policy and data processing practices. You may review ironSource's Privacy Policy for more details on how ironSource handles your data.

4. Opt-Out Option

    You can opt out of personalized ads by changing your device settings:

    - On Android: Go to Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization.
    - On iOS: Go to Settings > Privacy > Advertising > Limit Ad Tracking.

By continuing to use this app, you agree to the integration of Google AdMob & ironSource ads and the collection of your Advertising ID for advertising purposes.

Data Storage and Usage

The Dog List app stores the following data locally on your device:

1. Dog Breed Information

    The app downloads and caches information about 209 dog breeds from the Open Dog Registry (https://jackdavis01.github.io/open-dog-registry-fork/). This data includes:
    - Breed names and characteristics
    - Personality traits
    - Physical attributes (coat style, texture, size, lifespan)
    - Behavioral information
    - Care requirements
    - High-quality breed images

    This data is cached locally for 30 days to provide offline access and improve app performance. No personal information is associated with this cached data.

2. User Preferences

    The app stores your favorite dog breeds locally on your device using SharedPreferences. This information:
    - Never leaves your device
    - Is not transmitted to any server
    - Can be cleared at any time by clearing app data

3. No Personal Data Collection

    The Dog List app does NOT collect, store, or transmit:
    - Your name or email address
    - Your location data
    - Your contacts or photos
    - Any other personally identifiable information
    
    The only data shared with third parties is the Advertising ID for ad personalization purposes, as described above.

Internet Connection

The app requires an internet connection for the following purposes:

1. Initial download of dog breed data from the Open Dog Registry
2. Downloading and caching dog breed images
3. Displaying advertisements (Google AdMob and ironSource)
4. Refreshing breed data when the 30-day cache expires

Once the data is cached, you can browse dog breeds offline. Images are automatically cached for offline viewing.

Open Source and Transparency

This app is open source, and you can review the complete source code on GitHub. The code demonstrates that:
- No user tracking or analytics are implemented beyond advertising SDKs
- All data is stored locally using standard Flutter/Dart libraries
- No backend servers collect or store user data
- The app follows privacy best practices

Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the app and on this page. Continued use of the app after such changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

Your Rights

You have the right to:
- Access the data stored by the app (which is limited to cached breed data and your favorites)
- Delete all app data by clearing the app's storage in your device settings
- Opt out of personalized advertising as described above
- Uninstall the app at any time
